## Motivational Pok√©mon

**Motivational Pok√©mon** is a fun web app built for my final project from the [SheCodes Plus AI workshop](https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/17346-jordan-goldtooth). It combines the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) with the [SheCodes AI API](https://www.shecodes.io/) to deliver motivational messages paired with your favorite Pok√©mon. Whether you're a Pok√©mon fan or just need a positive boost, this app has you covered!
